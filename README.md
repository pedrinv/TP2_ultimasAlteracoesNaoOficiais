# Solar System OpenGL Simulation

## Project Setup

1. Create a GLUT project in CodeBlocks.

2. In the main file of the project, paste the code from one of the provided main files.

3. Create a file named "carregartextura.h".

4. When prompted, associate the file with the current project by selecting "Yes".

5. Paste the code from the "carregartextura.h" file in this GitHub repository into the newly created "carregartextura.h" file.

6. Create a file named "carregartextura.cpp".

7. When prompted, associate the file with the current project by selecting "Yes".

8. Paste the code from the "carregartextura.cpp" file in this GitHub repository into the newly created "carregartextura.cpp" file in your project.

9. Download the "Sol.bmp" and "Estrelas_SkyBoxes.bmp" images.

10. Place these images in the executable folder of your project. Typically, this is in the directory: ProjectFolder -> Bin -> Debug.

11. Compile and run the program.
